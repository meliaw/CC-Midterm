# CC-Midterm
Creative Coding Midterm Fall 2019:
My goal for the second week was to figure out how to make animations keep playing after a key was pressed and to figure out how to make my animations interesting/dynamic. It took me a little bit to figure out the logic but I did end up being able to make the animations that I envisioned for this project. At first, I thought it would be hard to create the animations the exact way I wanted. However,  once I figured out the logic for the first one, the rest were super easy to make so I did exceed my expectations about the level of difficulty. One of the biggest knowledge gaps I had to figure out was keeping an animation running after a key was pressed once. I didnâ€™t want people to have to hold down a key for the duration of the animation. I found the solution for that quickly though. If I had more time or were to do this project again I would want to come up with a lot more animations for each sound file to make it even better.
